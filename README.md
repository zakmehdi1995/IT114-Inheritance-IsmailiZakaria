Example Java project created via STS as Java Project, showing how to;
- create interfaces (Person, Studying), 
- create abstract base class that contain some common attribute and methods of classes that implement an interface (PersonBase),
- create multiple implementation classes of an interface (Professor, Student),

As example, at bash command line issue;<br>
mkdir -p /c/it114/exampleProjects

### get(clone) the project from github
cd to where you put your example projects.<br>
As example, at bash command line issue;<br>
cd /c/it114/exampleProjects ) <br>
git clone https://github.com/njit-it114/example-java-inheritance.git <br>
or<br>
git clone https://github.com/njit-it114/example-java-inheritance.git  whateverDirectoryNameYouWantStuffToBeClonedInto

## Project directory structure
- README.md this read me file
